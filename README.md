Android and dagger 2 basics.
Dagger2 all in one place – very simple easy steps to understand the basics of dagger2.
What dagger2
•	Dagger 2 is a compile-time evolution approach to dependency injection. Dagger is currently in active development, primarily internally at Google, with regular pushes to the open-source community
•	It is dependency injection framework. 
•	How to handled dependency injection?
•	It uses DI using annotation. 
•	Dagger2 is based on javax.inject annotations standard. Eg. Internal API classes like 

Dependency injection – https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection

Why 
•	Is is restrictly generated implementation (no reflection) ie. Dagger2 is based on code generation not on Reflection.
•	Reduces the code coupling – makes code loosely coupled
•	User needs to use the object without any headache how to create the object of components.
•	# copied from developer’s android - 
o	Dagger's static, compile-time implementation means that it can be used in Android apps without needless runtime cost or memory usage.
