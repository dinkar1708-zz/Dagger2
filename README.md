Android Dagger2 Dependency Injection
Dagger2 all in one place – Very simple easy steps to understand the basics of dagger2.

This post covers the basics of dagger2 a depedency injection for android framework, making coding simple and easy.

What dagger2 -
·         Dagger 2 is a compile-time evolution approach to dependency injection.
·         Dagger is currently in active development, primarily internally at Google, with regular pushes to the open-source community
·         It is dependency injection framework.
·         How to handled dependency injection?
·         It uses DI using annotation.
·         Dagger2 is based on javax.inject annotations standard. Eg. Internal API classes like

Dependency injection – https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection

Why -
·         Is is restrictly generated implementation (no reflection) ie. Dagger2 is based on code generation not on Reflection.
·         Reduces the code coupling – makes code loosely coupled
·         User needs to use the object without any headache how to create the object of components.
·         # copied from developer’s android -
o   Dagger's static, compile-time implementation means that it can be used in Android apps without needless runtime cost or memory usage.

1. app - basic setup of dagger2
2. dagger2Netmodule - shows how to setup basic network request API
